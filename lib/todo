Feedforward IS working (!)

Must implement an iterative backpropagation algorithm.
	- Starts with outputs and calculates delta there.
	- Moves back to weights connecting to outputs, calculates delta for each line
	- Moves back to each previous layer, calculating deltas to assist the weights before it.


Both for testing and for visual effect (number tables are lame!)
	- Implement a jcomponent that displays the state of a neural network
		- Inputs, weights (graphically), hidden layers, outputs, error
	- Possibly then shift over to LWJGL, for speed -- but less portability :(

USE IT!!!
	- AND, OR, and XOR gates
		- Testing, mostly
	- Fun stuff



Current State:
	- Error calculation for last layer should work
	- Still need to work in an iterative solution that works for however many layers

1. Track management
- Store multiple tracks (from a folder, share tracks among programs, etc.)
- Easily create complex tracks
- Overlapping? == BIG change.
	- Zed coordinate or simply multiple tracks?
- Switching between different tracks with the same car pool.

2. Improve the calculation of intersecting lines and such
- Represent lines as vectors, and calculate intersections without nasty division by zero
- Store paths (and tracks) as arrays (or lists?) of lines instead of points.
- Paths should be able to rotate (in real time???)

3. Train neural networks off of PID output? (Variable or PWM?)
